		The music of Ice Cream may not be as innocently sweet as the treat they’re named after, but they’ll certainly delight anyone with even a passing interest in garage rock.

		You expect a certain sound when you hear of a band called Ice Cream. You expect the sound of summer, or maybe you expect bubbly, refreshing pop ‘n’ roll or maybe you just expect it to be a bunch of teenage girls in sparkly pantsuits dancing to a pre-recorded beat. Ice Cream is just about none of these...
